# This program is supposed to print out the names of the brothers in alphabetical order, but it's not working quite right yet. Please fix the program so that the names are printed in the correct order.

# print("Simeoni")
# print("Juhani")
# print("Eero")
# print("Lauri")
# print("Aapo")
# print("Tuomas")


#solution below 

brothers = ["Simeoni", "Juhani", "Eero", "Lauri", "Aapo", "Tuomas", "Timo"]

brothers.sort()

for name in brothers:
    print(name)
# The code above creates a list of brothers' names, sorts them in alphabetical order, and then prints each name on a new line.
